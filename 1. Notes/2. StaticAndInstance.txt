Static And Instance

	When a class member includes a static modifier, the member is 
called as static member. When no static member is present the member is 
called as non static member or instance member.

Static - 
0. Static members are invoked using the name of the class.
1. Static Constructor Does not allow access modifiers.
2. Static constructors are used to initialize static fields in a class.
3. Static Constructors are called before instance Constructors.
4. Static Constructor is called only once.

Instance - 
0. Instance members are invoked using the instance or object of the class.
1. An Instance member belongs to specific instance(object) of a class.
2. If I create 3 objects of a class I will have 3 sets of instance members in the memory,
   whereas there will be only one copy of a static member.
