Interfaces

1. Interfaces can be created using interface keyword. Just like classes
   interfaces also contains properties, methods, delegates or events, but
   only declarations and no implementations.
2. It is a compile time error to provide implementation for any interface member.
3. Interface members are public by default and they don't allow explicit access modifiers.
4. Interfaces cannot contain fields.
5. If a class or a struct inherits from an interface, it must provide implementation for all
   interface members. Otherwise, we get a compile error.
6. A class or a struct can inherit from more than one interface at the same time, but where as,
   a class cannot inherit from more than once class at the same time.
7. Interfaces can inherit from other interfaces. A class that inherits this interface must provide
   implementations for all interface member in the entire interface inheritance chain.
8. We cannot create an instance of an interface, but an interface reference variable can point to a
   derived class object.

Interface Naming Convention: Interface names are prefixed with capital "I".
