Structs

1. Structs are very similar to classes. We use struct keyword to create a struct.
2. Just like classes structs can have fields, properties, constructors and methods.

There are several Differences between classes and structs
1. A struct is a value type where as a class is a reference type.
2. Structs are stored on stack, where as classes are stored on the heap.
3. Value types hold their value in memory where they are declared, but reference
   types hold a reference to an object in memory.
4. Value types are destroyed immediately after the scope is lost, where as for
   reference types only the reference vaiable is destroyed after the scope is lost.
   The object is later destroyed by garbage collector.
5. When you copy a struct into another struct, a new copy of that struct gets created and
   modifications on one struct will not affect the values contained by the other struct.
6. When you copy a class into another class, we only get a copy of the reference variable.
   Both the reference variables point to the same object on the heap. So, operations on
   one variable will affect the values contained by the other reference variable.
