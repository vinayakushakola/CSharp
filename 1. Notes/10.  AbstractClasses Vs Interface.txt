Abstract Classes Vs Interfaces

1. Abstract classes can have implementation for some of its members(Methods), but the
   interface can't have implementation for any of its members.
2. Interfaces cannot have fields where as an abstract class can have fields.
3. An interface can inherit from another interface only and cannot inherit from an abstract
   class, where as an abstract class can inherit from another abstract class or another
   interface.
4. A class can inherit from multiple interfaces at the same time, where as a class cannot
   inherit from multiple (abstract)classes at the same time.
5. Abstract class members can have access modifiers where as interface members cannot 
   have access modifiers.
