Abstract Classes

1. The abstract keyword is used to create abstract classes.
2. An abstract class is incomplete and hence cannot be instantiated.
3. An abstract class can only be used as base class.
4. An abstract class cannot be sealed.
5. An abstract class may contain abstract members(Methods, Poperties, Indexers & Events),
   but not mandatory.
6. A non-abstract class derived from an abstract class must provide implementation for all
   inherited abstract members.

If a class inherits an asbtract class, there are 2 options available for that class
Option 1: Provide Implementation for all the abstract members inherited from the 
	  base abstract class.
Option 2: If the class does not wish to provide implementation for all the abstract members
	  inherited from the abstract class, then the class has to be marked as abstract.
